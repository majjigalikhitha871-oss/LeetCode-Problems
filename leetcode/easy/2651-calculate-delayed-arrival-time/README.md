# Calculate Delayed Arrival Time

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount of delay in hours.

Return  *the time when the train will arrive at the station.* 

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 
Output: 20 
Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= arrivaltime < 24
- 1 <= delayedTime <= 24

        return (arrivalTime+delayedTime)%24;
    }
}
```
